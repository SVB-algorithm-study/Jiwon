## 🗒️ Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## 📌 Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4`
- All the integers in `nums` are unique.
- `nums is sorted in ascending order.
