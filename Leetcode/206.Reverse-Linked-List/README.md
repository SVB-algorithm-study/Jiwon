## 🗒️ Problem Description
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list.*

## 📌 Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`


## 🫧 Follow up
A linked list can be reversed either **iteratively or recursively.** Could you implement both?
